    <div class="research-note">
        <p><strong>Research Focus:</strong> My work examines how political elites use progressive values to justify illiberal policies, particularly around immigration and gender equality. I employ experimental methods to understand when and how citizens trade off between different political principles.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Open Science:</strong> All replication materials and pre-registration documents are available on my <a href="https://github.com/sophiemainz">GitHub</a>. I believe in transparent, reproducible research.</p>
